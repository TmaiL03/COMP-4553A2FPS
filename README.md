The game can be found and played at the following Itch.io URL: https://161568t.itch.io/ghostrunner

#### PLAYING THE GAME:
Movement: Use W/A/S/D or the arrow keys to navigate around the map.
Camera Movement: Use the mouse to move the camera view along the horizontal axis (vertical axis is intentionally locked). 
Shooting: Left clicking the mouse will register a shot in the direction of the crosshair overlaid using the UI.
Healing: Walk over the red-cubed medical kits to increase your health.

#### GAME END:
Defeating Opponents: If a shot's RayCast collides with an opponent, they will immediately die and disappear. This will also add 100 points to your score. If you defeat all opponents, you win the game.
Defeat: Opponents will shoot fireballs at you, if they hit you, you will lose one health point. If you lose all of your health points, the game ends.

#### Additional Features:
Footsteps: Two different audio clips to enhance the experience when the player wanders around the map.
Sparks: A very primitive particle effect applied when shots collide with walls.
